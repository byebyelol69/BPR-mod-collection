FAQ:
Q: Is this menu compatible with Brick Remastered or tother mods?
A: It should be compatible with all mods, but i would not suggest mixing many of them. Remove my old menu if you still use it.

Q: I don't see my favorite feature. Why is that?
A: Because I haven't had time to add evrything yet. Also, some things will not be added since they can be abused for cheating,

Q: My game crashed at some point, what to do?
A: Report it to me, I will take a look, but add some additional info, I am not a mind reader, so I need to know when it crashed, what you did etc.

Q: Menu doesn't show up, what to do?
A: Press ` key on your keyboard and it will appear,

Q: Why are there empty slots in the dashboard?
A: They will be added later.

Q: I have another question, suggestion for a new feature, can I share it with you?
A: Of course, contact me on Discord and we will discuss it.
